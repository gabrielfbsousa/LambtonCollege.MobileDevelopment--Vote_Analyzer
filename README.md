## Project Detailing
### Details
This project was developed as the Final Project for the specified course. The main idea of Vote Analyzer is to be an app to help people on Brazil to identify if the candidate they intend to vote on the next elections is in sync on what the citizen values. In order to manipulate the system, the citizen simply needs to fill the number of the candidate into the app, just like they would do on the elections day.

After that, Vote Analyzer will take how that candidate has voted on recent important topics for the country, like the reformations, the impeachments' voting and others. Alongside, it will be displayed if that candidate has already been cited on condemned for corruption in any of the most recent scandals. Of course, if the candidate was not previously occupying any public role, nothing will be shown in both.
